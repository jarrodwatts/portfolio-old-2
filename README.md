# Jarrod's Portfolio

This is a simple Next.js application to showcase my latest work.

It pulls in data from YouTube and Hashnode to display my latest videos and blog posts.

It's built with:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Material UI & CSS Modules

Feel free to use this as a template for your portfolio if you like it!
